    I work as a Applied Scientist for AWS AI where I explore the intersection of Machine Learning,
    Deep Learning and Causality. In particular, I am interested building models that understand
    notions of objects present in the real world.<br />

    Prior to my position at AWS I was a PhD Student in Machine Learning and Computational Biology
    at ETH ZÃ¼rich and worked on the development of <b>deep learning methods for real world
    medical time series</b>, <b>Dimensionality Reduction</b> and <b>Topological Machine Learning</b>.<br />

    My interests include but are not limited to: <b>Machine Learning for
    Healthcare</b>, <b>Probabilistic Modelling</b>, <b>Time Series Modelling</b> and
    <b>Interpretable Machine Learning</b>.<br />

    Here I write about stuff I care about in the realm of science, programming,
    technology and crypto.  All opinions expressed are solely my own and do not
    express the views or opinions of my employer.
